I was lucky enough to be able to present my work this week at Silicon
Therapeutics, thanks for having me!

I've made the slides available in this repository on gitlab
[[https://gitlab.com/salotz/presentation.sitx_interview_2020-12/-/raw/master/presentation.pdf][at this location as a PDF]].

Presentation roughly covers these topics:

- Kinetics oriented drug design
- Description of the Weighted Ensemble (WE) class of enhanced sampling
  algorithms
- Motivation and design of the [[https://github.com/ADicksonLab/wepy][wepy]] framework for performing and
  analyzing WE simulations as well as prototyping new methods.
- Results for my PhD research into ligand unbinding transition state
  structure for clinically relevant target soluble epoxide hydrolase.
