There is a new section on my webpage dedicated to [demos](link://slug/portfolio) that can be run in the
browser. Check out the first one: [Godot 2D Creeps](link:///demos/godot-2d-creeps).

Its not very interesting as it is just the 2D game from the Godot documentation,
but I am posting here as a proof of concept.
