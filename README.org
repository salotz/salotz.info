* Instructions


You'll need nikola installed. We aren't using anything custom in the
env so pipx install should do:

#+begin_src bash
pipx install Nikola[extras]
#+end_src

Then just build the page:

#+begin_src bash
nikola build
#+end_src

Preview and autobuild:

#+begin_src bash
nikola auto
#+end_src



** Writing Posts

To add new posts just use their command. You can always do it manually
but it will get dates and stuff for you done well.

#+begin_src bash
nikola new_post -2 -f orgmode -t "my post name"
#+end_src

I use the TOML format for metadata. Should look like this:

#+begin_src fundamental
  +++
  title = "Cron alternative with runit and snooze"
  slug = "runit_snooze"
  date = "2020-10-23 11:16:36 UTC-04:00"
  tags = "tagA, tagB"
  link = ""
  description = ""
  type = "text"
  +++
#+end_src

Where the ~+++~ is for nikola using the Hugo style, since it basically
will do a textual inclusion to the top of the post files.

See here for full docs: [[https://getnikola.com/handbook.html#metadata-fields][The Nikola Handbook | Nikola]]

Points:

- Choose the slug to be nice
- Tags are comma separated
- link is unused
- description is used in <meta> tags for SEO
- type is:
  - 'text' :: normal long post
  - 'micro' :: for small posts in a big serif font


** Publishing

Make sure ~ghp-import~ is installed in the nikola env. For pipx:

#+begin_src bash
pipx install ghp-import
#+end_src

Publish to ~salotz.info~ which is configured in ~conf.py~:

#+begin_src bash
  keychain_login
  nikola github_deploy
#+end_src
