# Unit vs. Code Coverage

Talk about the difference of these two things and how while it should be easy to
automatically track unit coverage, code coverage seems more popular to use.

Both are useful and both should be used, but unit coverage is probably what you
want to start with trying to get 100% as this actually gives you a clear picture
of what is tested vs code coverage. Code coverage can give false sense of
security because you don't see that you haven't actually tested certain
functions just because they are called.
